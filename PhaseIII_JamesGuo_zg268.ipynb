    "Based on the result of my exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Phase II, I discovered potential relationships between [`yearsofexperience`, `yearsatcompany`, `basesalary`, `bonus`] and `totalyearlycompensation`, and between [`gender`, `masters_degree`, `bachelors_degree`, `doctorate_degree`, `highschool`, `some_college`, `race_asian`, `race_white`, `race_two_or_more`, `race_black`, `race_hispanic`] and `totalyearlycompensation`. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Because [`yearsofexperience`, `yearsatcompany`, `basesalary`, `bonus`] are non-categorical variables, so I plan to build a multiple linear regression model based on [`yearsofexperience`, `yearsatcompany`, `basesalary`, `bonus`] as predictor variables and `totalyearlycompensation` as the response variable. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Outcome:** I plan to work out an equation revealing the relationship between [`yearsofexperience`, `yearsatcompany`, `basesalary`, `bonus`] and `totalyearlycompensation`. People can use their numbers in real life to predict their salaries: that is, people plug in how many years they have worked in relevant careers, at a specific company, and their base salary and bonus into the equation to predict how high their predicted salary is.<br><br>\n",
